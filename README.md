Notes
OCR quality depends on your PDFsâ€™ scan quality.

The app runs entirely on your machine, so your documents remain private.

Embedding and search might take some time for large documents depending on your CPU.

For better performance, consider running on a machine with at least 8GB RAM and a modern CPU.
